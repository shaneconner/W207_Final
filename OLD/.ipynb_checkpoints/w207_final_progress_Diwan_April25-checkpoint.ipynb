    "# San Francisco Crime Classification\n",
    "*Predict the category of crimes that occurred in the city by the bay*\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kaggle Project Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime)\n",
    "\n",
    "From 1934 to 1963, San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the world's most notorious criminals on the inescapable island of Alcatraz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the city is known more for its tech scene than its criminal past. But, with rising wealth inequality, housing shortages, and a proliferation of expensive digital toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the bay.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Sunset to SOMA, and Marina to Excelsior, this competition's dataset provides nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods. Given time and location, you must predict the category of crime that occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also encouraging you to explore the dataset visually. What can we learn about the city through visualizations like this Top Crimes Map? The top most up-voted scripts from this competition will receive official Kaggle swag as prizes."

    "    (1) 'Dates' column includes a good amount of detail -- year, month, and time of day. Additionally, there is a 'DayOfWeek' column which also includes the day of week. The 'Dates' column can be subset into three different columns though year likely won't be quite as useful unless we opt to weight more recent results to better incorporate trends. Though the time of year and day of the week will likely be useful since certain crimes are often more probably based on the season and day of the week.\n",
    "    (2) The columns 'PdDistrict', 'Address', 'X', and 'Y' all refer to location. This will be beneficial since certain crimes will probably be more likely in certain district and will aid in classification. 'X' and 'Y' seem to be coordinates so those could potentially be concatenated and used to generate informative visualizations.\n",
    "    (3) Furthermore, the 'Address' column seems to be specific to one location, block, or corner. Perhaps we can subset this information which will better classify crime based on the type of address information given. (i.e., vandalism will be more likely for an exact address while vehicle theft be more likely for a block)."
